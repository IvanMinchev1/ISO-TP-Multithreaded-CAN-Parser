# ISO-TP Multithreaded CAN Parser

This project implements a multithreaded parser for ISO-TP (ISO 15765-2) transport layer messages transmitted over raw CAN frames.

It reads frames from a plain text file and reconstructs complete ISO-TP messages by interpreting the different frame types: Single Frame (SF), First Frame (FF), Consecutive Frame (CF), and Flow Control (FC). Output is ordered according to the original file.
